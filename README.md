<h1><b>Welcome to Rental Car Showcase! 🚗✨</b></h1>

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **Rental Car Showcase**, your one-stop solution for browsing and reserving cars for rent. Whether you're planning a weekend getaway or need a ride for business, we've got a range of vehicles to suit your needs.

<h3><b>What’s Inside?</b></h3>

Here’s a quick overview of what this project includes:

<b>About Us Page:</b> Get to know who we are and why we’re passionate about car rentals.

<b>Cars Page:</b> Explore our collection of amazing cars with details like prices and availability. Spoiler: There’s a MINI Cooper and a Range Rover! 🚙

<b>Login Page:</b> Secure login for users to access personalized features and manage their rentals.

<h3><b>How It Works</b></h3>

This is a simple web project built with HTML and CSS (for now), designed to give users an easy way to explore and reserve rental cars. It’s perfect for demonstrating the basic structure of a car rental platform.

<h3><b>How to Try It Out</b></h3>
