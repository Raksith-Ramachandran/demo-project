Car Rental Website Demo
This is a Car Rental Website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate the basic structure of a car rental service. This demo allows users to browse available cars, view details, and simulate a booking process without any back-end or database integration.

Features
Car Listings: View a list of cars available for rent, including details like model, price, and image.
Booking Simulation: Simulate the process of booking a car (no actual database or payment system).
Responsive Design: The website is mobile-friendly, using CSS to ensure it works well on a variety of screen sizes.
Car Filters: Users can filter the cars by type, price, and availability (implemented with basic JavaScript).
Tech Stack
Frontend:
HTML: For creating the structure and content of the website.
CSS: For styling and layout of the website (responsive design).
JavaScript: For interactivity, such as filtering car listings and handling bookings.
